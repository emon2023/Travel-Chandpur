            <h1 id="content">History Of Chandpur </h1> <br>
            <p>During the ruling of the Baro-Bhuiyans, this region was occupied by Chand Ray, the Zamindar of Bikrampur and son of Kedar Ray. According to historian J. M. Sengupta, the region was named Chandpur, following the name of Chand Ray. On the other hand, others say that the name of this region comes from Chand Faqir of Purindapur mahalla of Chandpur, Bangladesh. It is said that an administrator named Shah Ahmed Chand came here from Delhi in the fifteenth century and established a river port.

                In 1779 AD, Major James Rennel, a British surveyor, drew a map of Bengal during the British rule and included an obscure town called Chandpur. At that time, there were offices and courts at a place called Narsinghpur (which has now sunk) south of Chandpur. The confluence of the Padma and the Meghna was about 60 miles south-west of the present place. This area has now disappeared due to the game of breaking the Meghna river.
                
                The first Chandpur subdivision was formed in 1878 as a result of administrative reorganization during the British rule. On 1 October 1896, Chandpur city was declared as a municipality. It was declared as Chandpur district on 15 February 1984</p>
